## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 6

Consider the GDP information in `global_economy`. Plot the GDP per capita for each country over time. Which country has the highest GDP per capita? How has this changed over time?

### Lab Session 7

1. For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance.

    * United States GDP from `global_economy`
    * Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in `aus_livestock`
    * Victorian Electricity Demand from `vic_elec`.
    * Gas production from `aus_production`

2. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?
