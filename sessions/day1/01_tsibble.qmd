## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 1

 1. Download [`tourism.xlsx`](http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx) from [`http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx`](http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx), and read it into R using `read_excel()` from the `readxl` package.
 2. Create a tsibble which is identical to the `tourism` tsibble from the `tsibble` package.
 3. Find what combination of `Region` and `Purpose` had the maximum number of overnight trips on average.
 4. Create a new tsibble which combines the Purposes and Regions, and just has total trips by State.

### Lab Session 2

- Create time plots of the following four time series: `Bricks` from `aus_production`, `Lynx` from `pelt`, `Close` from `gafa_stock`, `Demand` from `vic_elec`.
- Use `help()` to find out about the data in each series.
- For the last plot, modify the axis labels and title.
