## Lab sessions

### Lab Session 14

Try forecasting the Chinese GDP from the `global_economy` data set using an ETS model.

Experiment with the various options in the `ETS()` function to see how much the forecasts change with damped trend, or with a Box-Cox transformation. Try to develop an intuition of what each is doing to the forecasts.

[Hint: use `h=20` when forecasting, so you can clearly see the differences between the various options when plotting the forecasts.]

### Lab Session 15

Find an ETS model for the Gas data from `aus_production` and forecast the next few years.

  * Why is multiplicative seasonality necessary here?
  * Experiment with making the trend damped. Does it improve the forecasts?
